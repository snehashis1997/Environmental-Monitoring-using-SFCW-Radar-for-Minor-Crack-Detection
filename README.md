# Environmental-Monitoring-using-SFCW-Radar-for-Minor-Crack-Detection
This is my "Final year Btech project topic".In this project along with my teammates, we try to develop a Radar Cross Section based SFCW Radar in Matlab and detect the minor cracks in Hilly Regions. We also use Python based image processing algorithm for locating the cracks.
